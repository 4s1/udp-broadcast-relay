                          UDP Broadcast Packet Relay

   This program listens for packets on a specified UDP broadcast port.
   When a packet is received, it sends that packet to all specified
   interfaces but the one it came from as though it originated from the
   original sender.

   The primary purpose of this is to allow games on machines on separated
   local networks (Ethernet, WLAN) that use udp broadcasts to find each
   other to do so.

   It also works on ppp links, so you can log in from windows boxes (e.g.
   using pptp) and play LAN-based games together. Currently, you have to
   care about upcoming or downgoing interfaces yourself.

INSTALL

   make ; cp udp-broadcast-relay /some/where

USAGE

   /some/where/udp-broadcast-relay id udp-port eth0 eth1...

   udp-broadcast-relay must be run as boot to be able to create a raw
   socket (necessary) to send packets as though they originated from the
   original sender.

COMPATIBILITY

     * I run debian woody with Linux 2.4.20, and here it works.

EXAMPLE

   /some/where/udp-broadcast-relay -f 1 6112 eth0 eth1 # forward Warcraft
   3 broadcast packets
